This comprehensive guide is a one-stop resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of JavaScript assertion tools. Testing and test automation make up a significant portion of the development process, and assertions play a critical role within these processes. However, with numerous Javascript assertion tools and practices available, each with its own unique advantages, figuring out what you need can be a challenge. That's where the JS Assertion CheatSheet comes in.

Our goal with the JS Assertion CheatSheet is to assist engineers by providing a single source of truth for understanding and applying the most suitable assertion practices. We aim to curate a variety of both common and special assertions used within different tools into an easy-to-understand, searchable, and reusable format. By organizing this information in a more manageable way, we hope to make the process of dealing with JavaScript assertions simpler and more accessible to everyone, from beginners to experienced developers.

In this guide, you'll find:

- A detailed exploration of various JavaScript assertion tools.
- Comprehensive documentation of common and special assertions in these tools.
- Practical, actionable tips for using these assertions efficiently.
- A platform for contributing, learning, and improving assertion practices.

As this cheat sheet is an open-source project, we strongly encourage contributions from our users. So, whether you wish to add a new tool to our repository, suggest a common practice or perhaps fix a minor error, your help will be much appreciated. Your unique insights and expertise will help enrich this documentation, significantly benefitting the entire community.

We hope you find the JS Assertion CheatSheet helpful in your development journey and look forward to your valuable contributions!
